Crazy Quiz App - Repository Description
Welcome to the Crazy Quiz App! This interactive and fun quiz application allows users to answer a series of questions, progress through them, and test their knowledge on various topics. The app is designed to be simple, user-friendly, and responsive, making it accessible across a variety of devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

Overview
The Crazy Quiz App is built using core web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository contains the full source code for the app, allowing users to easily clone or fork it for personal use or further development. The app provides a clean and intuitive interface where users can engage with a series of questions, select answers, and move through the quiz in a dynamic and interactive way.

Features
Responsive Design: The quiz adapts to different screen sizes, making it functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

Dynamic Question Loading: Questions and answers are dynamically displayed, ensuring the quiz can easily be extended with new content.

Next Button: After answering a question, users can proceed to the next one by clicking the "Next" button. The button appears only after an answer is selected, enhancing the user experience.

Simple User Interface: The app has a clean, minimalistic interface that allows users to focus on the quiz itself. The design is intuitive and easy to navigate.

Customization Ready: This app can be easily customized in terms of style (via CSS) and functionality (via JavaScript), allowing developers to adapt it to their specific needs.

How It Works
The app works by dynamically injecting questions and answer choices into the page using JavaScript. Here's a high-level overview of how the quiz flows:

Initial Load: When the user first visits the page, they are greeted with the "Crazy Quiz" heading and a placeholder message that prompts the user to start answering questions.

Dynamic Question Display: Once the user begins the quiz, the app loads questions from a predefined set and displays them on the screen. Each question is accompanied by multiple-choice answers.

Answer Selection: Users can select their answer by clicking one of the available answer buttons. The app uses JavaScript to track the user's selection and provide immediate feedback.

Next Question: After an answer is selected, a "Next" button appears, allowing users to proceed to the next question in the quiz. This interaction ensures a smooth transition between questions.

End of Quiz: After all the questions are answered, the app can display a result screen showing the user's score or offer them the option to retake the quiz.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the quiz layout and creating the elements such as buttons, questions, and answers.
